# Forms and Filter

## Overview

Today is the last day of our Gallery Of Horns. You have horned creatures displaying on the page. When you click on a beast, you increase its favorites and display it as a modal. Today we will be adding one more piece of functionality: filtering by numbers of horns.

### Feature 1. Filter by Numbers of Horns

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to be able to view the beasts by the number of horns

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user is presented with filtering options  
When the user clicks on one option  
Then the images should be filtered accordingly

#### How are we implementing it?

- Using the `Form` component of `react-bootstrap`, build a drop down menu so that the user can choose to filter by number of horns.
- When the user chooses one of the options, the correct images should be displayed.
